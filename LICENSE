4. Public Token Network Fork Allocation

   4.1. Definitions

   For the purposes of this license:

   - “Software” means the Atto node implementation contained in this
     repository and any derivative works of it.

   - A “Token Network” is any blockchain, DAG, or comparable distributed
     ledger network whose consensus or transaction processing is implemented
     using the Software or a derivative of it, and which has a native coin,
     token, or other cryptographic asset (a “Token”).

   - A “Public Token Network” is a Token Network where any third party
     who is not under your control or common ownership can obtain, hold, or
     transfer the Token (for example by downloading a wallet or node, using a
     public API, or trading the Token on an exchange).

   - A “Private Network” is a Token Network used only within a single
     organization (and its contractors), where the Token is not made available
     to the general public and is not offered for public trading or sale.

   4.2. Allocation Requirement for Public Token Network Forks

   If you use the Software, or any derivative of it, to create or operate a
   Public Token Network whose native Token is different from the Atto
   (ATTO) token, then as a condition of this license you must allocate to the
   entity that maintains Atto (the “Atto Project”) a portion of that Token
   equal to one percent (1%) of the total token supply (the “Atto
   Allocation”).

   - If the Token has a fixed maximum supply, “total Token supply” means that
     maximum supply.
   - If the Token has no fixed maximum supply, “total Token supply” means the
     total number of Tokens in existence at the time the network first becomes
     publicly available, and you must ensure that the Atto Allocation remains
     at least one percent (1%) of the circulating supply unless the Atto
     Project agrees otherwise in writing.

   4.3. Delivery of the Atto Allocation

   You must deliver the Atto Allocation to one or more addresses designated by
   the Atto Project within ninety (90) days of the Public Token Network’s
   public launch. The Atto Project may publish or update the official
   allocation address(es) through its official channels.

   4.4. Exemption for Private Networks

   This Section 4 does not apply to Private Networks. You may freely
   create, run, and use Private Networks based on the Software without any
   obligation to provide an Atto Allocation.

   4.5. No Waiver

   If the Atto Project does not enforce this Section 4 in a particular case,
   that does not mean it waives the right to enforce it in other cases.
